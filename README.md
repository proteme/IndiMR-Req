# About

The requirements for [IndiMR ](http://IndiMR.org)are listed in the following pages.

Except the first two pages, each page lists the requirements and features that are relevant to one type of user. The first two pages list requirements that are applicable system wide or all users in general. 

Some of the use cases listed here will  be parsed out at a later stage to be made available through add-ons, since they do not deal with the clinical process directly. An example is health insurance related use cases. We are listing those requirements/use cases here for convenience, for the time being. 

The last page in this "book" contains a description of the early model for the[ IndiMR system](http://indimr.org).

**Note:** _this is a work in progress and this document  will change frequently_.
