# General – User Aspects

### Not Just an EMR

Following the general parlance, we call the system an EMR. However, IndiMR shall be more than a simple EMR system. It will be Wellness Electronic Record System, Personal Electronic Record System, EMR system, Public Health Record System, all rolled into one. The data about individuals and groups will seamlessly flow from one set of tools for one purpose to another with a different purpose.

### An application and a system for Configurators

Once the system has been developed, the role of the developers should be minimal.  
 The entire system should be developed and maintained by the users and their appointed configurators who are not programmers.

Effectively our "end users" will not be the end users, they will be the ones configuring the system

Some roles, e.g., the doctor, nurse, admin etc. would overlap with that of configurators. These will be allowed accessed to the tasks on a granular basis

### Role based privilege control and views

### Interface compatible with small devices

### Controlled Delegation

Controlled Delegation means allowing a higher-level expert being able to delegate actions to a lower level one without losing the control. This is specifically to deal with lack of skilled physicians in far flung areas but a situation that requires addressing even now.  
 The Delegator will be able to get the data from the Delegatee through smartphone videos, data entered or by voice.  
 The delegator will also be able to create actionable knowledge that can be replayed by the delegate. \(like Proteus\)

### Automatic change of language for the entire interface or one section

### Crowdsourcing and Uber for Healthcare

Should provide quickly incorporating ad hoc healthcare workers into the team. This could be for the care of individuals such as the aged patients with multiple chronic diseases, or in a situation of disaster when many untrained or semi-skilled volunteers are needed to fill up the gaps in the workforce.

### No save buttons or actions

All data is saved the instant it is entered.  
 If the user intends to correct it, he/she may undo it

### Intelligent Workflow Orientation

Three  panels outside the main work area that keep changing the contents of the lists within them as the data gets changed as the user enters data or performs tasks

1. Inference Panel \(with prioritized list of inferences reached, like an assistant peering over the shoulder saying, "hmmm .... this looks like fibroid", and when more data gets entered, "no wait, this could be a solid ovarian tumor"
2. Ruled out: “This is definitely not endometriosis”
3. Action Panel \(with four sections\)
   1. Must do
   2. Strongly recommended
   3. Consider these too 
   4. Verboten:  “do what you like, but don’t ever do this”

### High user control over interface, workflow, reports etc.

Instead of a team of administrators managing the system behavior for the user, the users themselves modify the system. This could be along the organization's hierarchy, giving more control to higher ups, including control of things below them.

### Quick Actions

user can quickly search from all functions available to him/her by a few words spoken or typed and invoke them \(something like the command palette of Sublime Text\)

### Secure login preferably using mix of voice, face and fingerprint recognition

### Audio Interface

### Data Analysis

### Generate Reports

### Ability to search for patients or other users based upon access privileges

### Tools to communicate with the users and other stakeholders, including the \*crowd\*
