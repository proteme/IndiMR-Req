# Knowledge Curator \(user\)

Knowledge Curator is someone who creates and maintains the knowledge driving the system. KC provides the instructions to create data structures, workflows and rules to that govern them, which the computer then follows.

KC is different than a computer programmer. The latter writes the code in a programming language which computer understands, whereas KC's creations can be understood by any domain expert.

The programmers would create the tools that KC uses. If the system design permits and the tools are good, a KC can change much of the behavior of the applications pertinent to the end users. Therefore, a good KC is someone with knowledge of the healthcare domain. e.g., a doctor or a nurse.

Having the KC control the behavior of the system keeps the system in tune with the needs of the users, without having to depend on the programmers. It also reduces the cost of ownership of such systems. The KC should ideally be a clinician with a more interest in making computers work as they would like them to. The tools should be simple enough to get them up and running in days instead of training of weeks and months.
