# Configurator \(user\)

Think of the modern Content Management Systems \(CMSs\), like WordPress, Drupal and Joomla. These allow creating complete websites with advanced functionality without any coding skills. Sure, you need some training and experience with best practices, but you can get superb functionality without having to write the software yourself. A WordPress expert can deliver a very impressive and functional site without writing a single line of code. Such an expert is the **Configurator**. They cannot just use the native WordPress features, they can add new ones by simply adding other components and extensions that other developers have freely made available,

For the people developing the WordPress system, such configurators are the primary users. Let us think of the configurators as our primary users in the IndiMR development project.
